HIST

PROCESS
-------
(STEP 1)  cd CW1
cd (change directory)
THIS CODE IS USED TO NAVIGATE BETWEEN DIRECTORIES AND ALSO CHANGES THE DIRECTORY WE REQUIRE

(STEP 2)  ls
ls(list files)
THIS SHOWS THE AVAILABLE CONTENTS PRESENT IN THE DIRECTORY 

(STEP 3)  gcc -o process process.c
GCC IS USED FOR COMPILING THE C CODE 
-o process SPECIFIES OUTPUT FILE AS process
process.c IS USED AS A SOURCE CODE FILE FOR BEING COMPILED

(STEP 4)  ./process wildcat.hshex output.hshex 50
./process EXECUTES THE FILE process
wildcat.hshex IS THE INPUT FILE GIVEN BY THE PROGRAM
output.hshex IS THE OUTPUT FILE GENERATED BY THE PROGRAM
50 IS THE NOISE STRENGTH.

(STEP 5)  ./hsconvert -f output.hshex wildcat1.ppm
./hsconvert IS CONSIDERED AS A CONVERTER OR CONVERTING FUNCTION
output.hshex IS THE INPUT FILE THAT IS MEANT TO BE CONVERTED
wildcat1.ppm IS THE NEW FILE THAT IS BEING CREATED AND CONSIDERED AS OUTPUT

TASK 1 (NOISE)
--------------
NOISE CHANGES THE LOOK OF THE IMAGE BY ADDING RANDOM NOISE TO THE PRESENT IMAGE (wildcat.ppm).

WE ADD NOISE BY 
CONVERTING INPUT FILE (wildcat.hshex) INTO OUTPUT FILE (output.hshex) AND ADDING NOISE STRENGHT (10).

./process wildcat.hshex output.hshex 10

AND THEN WE CONVERT
THE OUTPUT FILE (output.hshex) INTO A PPM FILE (wildcat1.ppm) SO THAT WE CAN VIEW THE NEW FILE WITH NOISE.

./hsconvert -f PPM output.hshex wildcat1.ppm

TASK 2 (HIST)
-------------
HIST COMPUTES THE HISTOGRAM OF THE RGB VALUES USED IN THE IMAGE .

./process wildcat.hshex output.hshex 10

AFTER FOLLOWING THE NOISE HIST METHOD AND GENERATING NOISE , WE GET PIXEL VALUES OF ALL THE VALUES RANGING FROM 0-255 IN THE FORMAT

Loaded !
Value 0: 18 pixels
Value 1: 0 pixels
Value 2: 0 pixels
..................
Value 255: 0 pixels

WHICH SHOWS THAT HIST FUNCTION IS WORKING BY PROVIDING PIXEL VALUES FOR EACH VALUE.
